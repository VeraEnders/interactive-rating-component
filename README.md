## About the project 
This challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Users should be able to:

* Select and submit a number rating
* See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

## Features 

### Rating Submission

Users can select select and submit a number rating. 
After submitting a rating, the component dynamically updates the display to show a "Thank you" card state. It replaces the existing content with a new element created from the provided template.
